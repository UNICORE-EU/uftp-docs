Welcome to UFTP Documentation
=============================

**UFTP** (**U**\ NICORE **F**\ ile **T**\ ransfer **P**\ rotocol) is a high-performance data 
streaming library and file transfer tool with sharing capabilities. It can be also integrated 
into `UNICORE <https://www.unicore.eu>`_, allowing to transfer data from client to server 
(and vice versa), as well as providing data staging and third-party transfer between 
UFTP-enabled UNICORE sites.

UFTP is best used using the client-side application (:ref:`uftp-client`), but is easily integrated 
into custom applications due to its FTP compliance.
